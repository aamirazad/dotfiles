# My dotfiles

This repo is not meant to be used as a one stop shop of configs, but contains all the configs I've configured for my optimal use. Your welcome to copy the pars that you like. I got a lot of the code from https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots and adapted it for my use. There is also a few conflicting apps from me switching terminals for instance. Enjoy
